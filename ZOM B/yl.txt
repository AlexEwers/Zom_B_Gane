With Sora.

Win Condition:

- Try to keep him in the Mid Range as that's the point where it is risky to use his projectiles and his stubby limbs will struggle to get to me.
- Try to pressure him to go offstage/ledge, where his opitions are at it's worst and force him to recover as that's his weakest point of his gameplay.
- Aim to outrange him at Mid Range, and try to cover 45 degrees above him
- Control the pace of the battle and make it hard for them to throw projectiles

Opponent's Win Condition:

- Keep them at close range and pressure their shield with their safe Aerials  and Dtilt or at Far range and make them get hit by
- Try to get a good conversion off a Fire Arrow or attack and combo off it to their crazy strings.
- Control the pace of neutral with projectiles, movement and converting off hit confirming or how the opponent tries to avoid it.

Neutral:

Close: Just never get in this range, due to the absolute speed of this kids moves and combos, he will decimate any char in close range, let alone sora. If you are in this range, disengage and fall back to mid-range

Mid: This will be our best shot, it needs to be just out of Boomerang Range and just keep him out with bair/ and nair 1 and try to convert off them harder than Tim Jones and getting people to get to Jonestown if I have to. Aim to parry his moves. And if he hits your sheild, it's just safe... so just disengage and try not to

Long: Well not excatly the most ideal for me but not the best for YL, however he has fire arrow and speed so he can easily close this distance, so try not to be caught with one of these. Can be used to break up the pace as it's a stalemate but I can apply no pressure while he can start so don't stay there for long. 

- If I'm far away, approach the gap slowly and try to parry his moves.

Disadvantage:

When YL is comboing me, best to DI away from YL go to the ledge as if he tries to follow up offstage and overextends I could punish him.

When he's at the ledge, YL's ledgeroll and ledge getup are both the worst in the game: So stand in roll distance because I cannot get hit by an attack and Im close enough to punish neutral getup.

General tips

Look for patterns in the YL's blockstrings to get punishes in.
